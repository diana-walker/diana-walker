# Hi, I'm Diane 🙋‍♀️

I work at the intersection of marketing automation, AI workflows and creative engineering.  
My background blends GTM strategy, RevOps and hands-on systems building, helping teams turn ideas into scalable automated operations.

I design lightweight tools, scripts and processes that make complex workflows feel simple. My work spans CRM architecture, lifecycle systems, data quality frameworks, custom GPT agents and AI assisted workflows for Marketing and RevOps.

## More about me ✨
I connect strategy with implementation.  
15+ years across enterprise, agencies and entrepreneurship shaped how I approach systems: with clarity, performance and a creative lens. I enjoy prototyping, simplifying complexity and designing structures that teams can actually use.

My current focus is on AI powered GTM: enrichment, routing, lead management and agent assisted workflows that accelerate the pipeline.
